# oldUTAUarchive
Nexys' UTAU archive. Voicebanks up to 29/07/2023. Contains OpenUTAU stuff too.

## The purpose of this archive
This list of voicebanks and reclists was made with various purposes in mind:
* Preventing as many lost media cases as possible from Nexys' full UTAU history
* Having an auxiliar place to access old voicebanks
* Future reference for reverse engineering
* Make reclists available for anyone who might need them
* Save UTAU concepts/art that could get lost or be useful for future reference
This was decided due to some recent events where the voices up to July 2022 were forced to be deleted by external sources, and some content could be considered Lost Media.

## How to contribute
You can contribute by contacting Nexys in any social media.

If you have any kind of voicebank, picture, reclist... etc. that Nexys made and is not in the archive, feel free to contact Nexys to add it.

Please provide the source material too.

Web page data/Wiki will not be included unless you have it.

Please note many of the files you will find are probably duplicates/siglhtly different versions of each other.

There are also incomplete files, or files with Low Quality.

None of the data in the files was updated.
